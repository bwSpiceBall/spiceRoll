            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Hello! I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend
                development and internal applications. I have experience in
                designing scalable, maintainable solutions and a deep
                understanding of Agile methodologies.
                <br />
                <br />
                My work involves enhancing features, addressing technical debt,
                and improving code quality to meet the evolving needs of
                businesses. Collaboration with cross-functional teams, attention
                to detail, and a passion for reliable software drive my
                commitment to delivering impactful results.
                <br />
                <br />
                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, mentoring
                others, and contributing to open-source projects.
